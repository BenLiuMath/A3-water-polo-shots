    <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
    <p>
      <em>[How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?]</em>
    </p>
    <p>
	Although water polo statistics are widely kept at the level of national and international competition, these statistics are nearly always presented in tables, and unlike in other sports, few effective visualizations of these statistics have been developed. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3737929/">this paper</a> contains interesting statistic analyses of water polo success based on the <a href="http://www.omegatiming.com/Sport?sport=AQ">Omega Timing data</a> from several FINA World Championships, but lacks any visual representation of its results.
    </p>

    <p>
	Inspired by the baseball statistics example from class, our goal was to build an interactive graphic that allows the viewer to explore the contributions of different players on a team, as well as game patterns across team members. For the scope of this assignment, we decided to focus on offensive statistics, i.e. shots attempted (broken down by shot type) and shots scored. We visualize tournament data collected by Omega Timing during the 2017 FINAL Women's Water Polo World Championships.
    </p>

    <p>For a given team, questions that viewers might want to explore in this dataset include: 
	<ol>
	<li>Which players are the top scorers?</li>
	<li>Which players perform particularly well at a given shot type?</li>
	<li>How did a particular player perform at the various shot types?</li>
	<li>How does the team-wide accuracy, and number of shots taken, vary by shot type?</li>
	<li>How did shots and goals evolve over the course of the game? For example, are more shots taken when the score is close?</li>
	</ol>
    </p><p>Each of these questions might be addressed for a given game, or over the course of several games in the tournament. We now explain how our design decisions were guided by these considerations.
    </p>

    <h4>Scatterplots</h3>

    <p>At the top of the dashboard are several scatterplots showing <strong>number of shots taken</strong> vs. <strong>success rate</strong> (i.e. number of goals / number of shots, as a percentage). Each dot corresponds to one or more players; dots are sized according to the number of players they represent. Design considerations included:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Color</strong>:
	<li><strong>Dot Size</strong>:
	<li><strong>Axes</strong>:
	<li><strong>Team Average Bar</strong>: shows what the overall shooting accuracy of the team was, and also serves as a reference to pick out which players are above average on the team.
	<li><strong>Percentages on y-axis</strong>: we originally plotted number of goals on the y-axis, but then all player dots fall below the 45 degree line. In order to more effectively use the space, we switched to percentage accuracy as the measure of success. This also makes it easy to pick out which players have high accuracy, as opposed to which players simply take more shots.
	<li><strong>Small Multiples</strong>: we use small multiples to simultaneously view various shot types. The choice to break shots down by type is motivated by the fact that certain shot types are expected to have higher accuracy (e.g. extra player shots), and certain players take more of one type of shot than others (e.g. centre shots are usually restricted to only a few players on the team).
	<li><strong>Tooltips</strong>: hovering over a dot in the scatter plot shows the player corresponding to that statistic, as well as the exact ratio of shots/goals that led to that dot. If viewers notice that one dot appears to be an outlier, they can easily pick out who it corresponds to.
	</ul>
    </p>






    <h4>Timelines</h3>






	<ul>
	<li>Color: blue/grey easily distinguishable, grey for opponent shots/goals because naturally seems like background
	<li>Small multiples of timelines and scatter plots: simple to understand the rest after understanding one</li>
	<li>Scatterplots: can see individual players, can brush to connect them (compare performance on various shot types)</li>
	<li>Timelines: strip plots to visualize when the most action was occurring, when goals were scored. To avoid clutter, show the details of shots as tooltips (name, number, shot type, exact time). Exact time not as important as sequential nature and rough time in quarter, so generally okay to leave out details on the time axis.</li>
	</ul>

      <em>[Add: An overview of your design and development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?]</em>
